This app allows a user to see a variety of products and sort them according to cost or category. Each product also has a reviews section and most products have a few reviews already written. Once the user clicks on a product they can then create, edit, or delete any product or review.

To get the front-end to work with the back-end you must set up a .env file on both repositories and have postgres installed.
